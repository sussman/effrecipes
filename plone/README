Okay, starting my 3rd attempt at the recipe database.  Doing it all by
hand was waaaaay too time-consuming and wheel-reinventing.  Doing it
as a Zope application was nicer, but the learning curve was still
tremendously steep, and the results still looked ugly.  Hopefully
doing it in Plone is yet another step "upwards" in terms of avoiding
reinvention.


OS X plone installation:

  - start with "sudo /Applications/Plone2/Tools/start default"
  - site runs on localhost:8200
  - accounts:  'admin'/ root-passwd
               'sussman' / xxx


Architecture:

     Plone --> CMF --> Zope
     (highlevel --> web app --> web OS)

Notes from hazmat (Kapil Thangavelu <hazmat@objectrealms.net>):


  - use 'cmf' and 'archetypes', in particular.
  - create a 'cookbook' with a recipes attribute (btree)


Archetypes:

  - a way of defining new objects
  - object fields can be queried, organized, linked etc.  the "database-ness"
    is implicit in the functionality.
