Create python functions (or *classes*?) specifically for querying and
writing to each table.  These methods would encapsulate all of the SQL
queries under the hood.

Then the main script would devote itself to reading CGI data from
forms, passing them to the SQL classes, and generating dynamic HTML
results pages.

Come up with an import/export format ASAP, perhaps xml.  Though a
text-export format is also critical for emailing results to people.
Then if I decide to change the schema and rebuild the database from
scratch, we can dump/load as we do in svn.  It also means people can
start entering recipes right away (either via CGI or by handwriting
XML), and we won't risk losing the content.
