                             Effrecipes
         A recipe database for the web, using python/CGI/MySQL.

This software was started by Ben Collins-Sussman in February 2003, for
his wife Frances (a.k.a. "Eff").  Therefore, the DB schema and
software feature set is incredibly specific to Eff's needs.  If you
don't like it, too bad.  This is the perk Frances gets from marrying a
programmer.  :-)

Ben retains the copyright to this code, but license is GPL'd.  See the
file COPYING.

C. Mike Pilato helped design the db schema, and I'm guessing will
undoubtedly make the web interface look beauuuuutiful with CSS stuff.


Server Requirements
===================

* At least MySQL 3.23
* At least Python 2.X
* A webspace that can run CGI scripts


How to Install
==============

* Install a CGI-capable webserver, like Apache.
   
* Install Python 2.0 or later.

* Install MySQL 3.23 or later.

* Create a new 'effrecipes' database (and 'effuser') as root:

    $ mysql -u root -p < init-database.sql

* Initialize the 'effrecipes' database tables as user 'effuser':

    $ mysql -u effuser -p < init-tables.sql
    Enter password:  effuser

* If you want to destroy the database and start over, run

    $ mysql -u root -p
    Enter password:  XXXXX
    mysql> drop database effrecipes;
    Query OK

* Put the CGI scripts in some CGI-exported web directory.

    (For my apache-2.0 httpd.conf, I did something like this:)

   ScriptAlias /recipes/ "/home/sussman/projects/effrecipes/"
   <Directory "/home/sussman/projects/effrecipes">
    Options ExecCGI FollowSymLinks
   </Directory>
