                             Effrecipes
         A recipe database for the web, using python/CGI/MySQL.

This software was started by Ben Collins-Sussman in February 2003, for
his wife Frances (a.k.a. "Eff").  Therefore, the DB schema and
software feature set is incredibly specific to Eff's needs.  If you
don't like it, too bad.  This is the perk Frances gets from marrying a
programmer.  :-)

Ben retains the copyright to this code, but license is in the file
COPYING, which is essentially an Apache/BSD-style license.

For a complete list of authors, read the Subversion log messages.
C. Mike Pilato helped design the db schema, and I'm guessing will
undoubtedly make the web interface look beauuuuutiful with CSS stuff.


Required Tools
==============

* At least MySQL 3.23.
* Python 2.2
* A webserver that can run CGI scripts (like Apache)
* ...?


How to Install
==============

* Install a CGI-capable webserver, like Apache.

    (### any need for specific modules?)

* Install MySQL on your system.

    (### user accounts to create?)

* Create the database.

    $ mysql -u [username] -p < init-tables.sql

   init-tables.sql will create a new database called 'effrecipes'.
   Within this database, it creatse all the tables as user [username],
   and as a sanity check, prints out a list of the tables.

   If you want to destroy the database and start over, run

    $ mysql -u [username] -p
    Enter password:  XXXXX
    mysql> drop database effrecipes;
    Query OK

* Put the CGI scripts in some CGI-exported web directory.
